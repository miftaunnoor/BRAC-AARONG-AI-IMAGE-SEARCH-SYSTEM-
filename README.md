A Database-Driven AI Model for Predicting Clothes Information from Images. 

The aim of this project is to create an AI model that predicts the code and other details of a clothing item by analyzing a segment of its image. This will be achieved by using an image segment from a clothes picture to extract features, and based on that segment, the model will predict relevant product details such as code and category from the dataset. Additionally, a user interface will be developed, allowing users to upload images either through their camera or gallery for prediction. It helps teams instantly find products without delays, removing the hassle of manual searching when tags are missing or quick information is needed. Besides, helping Customers discover similar products with ease.

This project gave me hands-on experience with SQL, AI/ML, Image Processing and full-stack integration.
